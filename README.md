We have developed a cost effective smart speaker using Chat GPT, Google Cloud and Esp32 microcontroller which costs around Rs 1200. It also has an inbuilt Bluetooth by which we can connect our device to it and use it as speaker. We've built a smart speaker with AI features, combining hardware with sophisticated software. By integrating Chat GPT with ESP32 microcontrollers and audio playback, we've created a device that can have real-world conversations and do multiple tasks.
